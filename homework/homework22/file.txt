After ten, eleven (11), twelve (12), thirteen (13), fourteen (14), fifteen (15), sixteen (16), seventeen (17),
 eighteen (18), nineteen (19), and twenty (20) follow. These numbers are seen less in grocery stores, as most
  prices are 10 dollars or less; it is however worth knowing these numbers, generally and, in terms of grocery
   shopping, for when the bill must be paid.
After twenty, numbers such as twenty-five (25), fifty (50), seventy-five (75), and one hundred (100) follow. So
long as one knows the core number, or the number situated in the tens or hundreds position that determines the
 general amount, understanding these more complicated numbers won't be difficult. For example thirty-three (33)
  is simply "thirty" plus three; sixty-seven is "sixty" plus seven; and sixty-nine is simply "sixty" plus nine.
  To understand larger (and more intimidating numbers), interested persons first need to understand basic numbers,
   or numbers from one to ten, as they comprise each and every advanced number, or a multi-digit number that
   indicates a larger amount/quantity.
